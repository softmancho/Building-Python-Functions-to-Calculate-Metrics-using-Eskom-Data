One project that I am particularly proud of is when I worked as a Data Scientist at Eskom. As part of this project, I was tasked with developing seven functions using Python to calculate various metrics for the Eskom analytics team. These functions had to be able to process both numeric and text data, and I used my knowledge of list manipulation, dictionaries, basic statistics and aggregations, function definitions, and PEP8 coding style to complete the project. I was very satisfied with the final output of the functions, and I submitted them to the team at the end of the sprint. Overall, this project was a great example of my ability to apply my technical skills to real-world problems and deliver high-quality solutions.
